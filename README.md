# Identification of patients with a specific observable feature

Natural language processing (NLP) code to extract relevant information of the medical notes. 
Predictive model that gives us an accurate identification of patients with a specific observable feature (certain pathologies or health conditions) 

## Motivation
Despite the use of diagnostic code related to each health care service, it has been detected that in clinical practice errors can be introduced in said coding. These errors can impact the results obtained in clinical research by having patients that do not correspond to the pathology under study, or on the contrary, failing to identify all relevant patients.
